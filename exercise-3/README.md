# Exercise 3

This exercise introduces git branches. In git you can split your development into different branches, and change some of these, and merge the changes back to the others.

1. This exercise comes in two branches: a) master, this version, and b) complete, a version with solutions. List all the versions using _git_ and it's command line options.
There are three branches: HEAD (origin/master), complete, and master.

2. Modify this readme file by writing the git commands to find out branches (both local and remote) of the current repo!
git branch -a; git branch -r; git ls-remote
